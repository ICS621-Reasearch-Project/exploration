**How to Run the Java Code**

### Steps to Run WeightedTreeKnownDist:
**1. Set Up the Project Structure:**
* Create separate `.java` files for each class: `Node.java`, `Path.java`, `WeightedTreeXKnownDist.java`, and `TreeExplorationTest.java`.
* Organize these files into a suitable directory structure.

**2. Compile the Code:**
- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory containing your Java files.
- Use the following command to compile the code:
  ```bash
  javac *.java
  ```
- This will create `.class` files for each `.java` file.

**3. Run the Code:**
- To execute the program, use the following command:
  ```bash
  java TreeExplorationTest
  ```
- This will run the `main` method in the `TreeExplorationTest` class, initiating the tree generation, pathfinding, and result printing.
### Steps to Run WeightedTreeX:
**1. Set Up the Project Structure:**
* Create separate `.java` files for each class: `Node.java`, `NodeWrapper.java`, and `WeightedTreeX.java`.
* Organize these files into a suitable directory structure.

**2. Compile the Code:**
- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory containing your Java files.
- Use the following command to compile the code:
  ```bash
  javac *.java
  ```
- This will create `.class` files for each `.java` file.

**3. Run the Code:**
- To execute the program, use the following command:
  ```bash
  java WeightedTreeX
  ```
- This will run the `main` method in the `WeightedTreeX` class, initiating the tree generation, pathfinding, and result printing.
