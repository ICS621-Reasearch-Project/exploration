**How to Run the Java Code**

### Steps to Run WeightedTreeKnownDist:
**1. Set Up the Project Structure:**
* Create separate `.java` files for each class: `Node.java`, `Path.java`, `WeightedTreeXKnownDist.java`, and `TreeExplorationTest.java`.
* Organize these files into a suitable directory structure.

**2. Compile the Code:**
- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the directory containing your Java files.
- Use the following command to compile the code:
  ```bash
  javac *.java
  ```
- This will create `.class` files for each `.java` file.

**3. Run the Code:**
- To execute the program, use the following command:
  ```bash
  java TreeExplorationTest
  ```
- This will run the `main` method in the `TreeExplorationTest` class, initiating the tree generation, pathfinding, and result printing.

### Running on Different Operating Systems:
**Windows:**
* **Command Prompt:** Use the commands mentioned above directly in the command prompt.
* **PowerShell:** Use the same commands in PowerShell.
* **IDE:** Use the built-in run/debug configurations in your IDE.

**macOS:**

- **IDE:** Use the built-in run/debug configurations in your IDE.

**Linux:**
* **Terminal:** Use the commands mentioned above in the terminal.
- **IDE:** Use the built-in run/debug configurations in your IDE.

### Additional Tips:
* **Build Tools:** Consider using build tools like Maven or Gradle to automate the build and dependency management processes.
* **IDE Integration:** Utilize the powerful features of IDEs to streamline code editing, compilation, debugging, and testing.
* **Code Organization:** Keep your code well-organized and commented to improve readability and maintainability.

By following these steps and leveraging the power of Java development tools, you can effectively run your Java code on various operating systems.
